A version of the famous UNO game. 
This project was made for practise on OOP, inheritance and polymorphism.
The Players controlled by the program have simple guidelines on which they choose which card to play. For example, they will play a "Draw 2 Cards" card only if the previous player has played also a "Draw 2 Cards" on them or if they have nothing else to play. If the next player in turn has one card in his hand, though, they will not play the "Draw 2 Cards" to force him to take 2 cards necessarily. They are not yet AI. My next step is to edit the relatively simple code of these guidelines to implement euristic functions based on probabilities.
